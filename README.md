# What is this repository?
This repo is my university project for my bachelors in Cyber Security. As such, I will NOT be accepting pull requests.

## Why is it available publicly?
Because I was told I could, but also if I pretend that somebody is actually watching my progress, I might do some work prior to 6 hours before it's due in.

## NLP-IM-RAT?
* Natural Language Parsing
* Instant Messaging
* Remote Administration Tool

Doesn't that sound cool as hell?

## What is the title of the project?
I can't remember. I apparently didn't write it down anywhere. I'll figure it out later.

## What will you be writing the tool/bot in?
Likely Node.JS, though since I'm not technically being graded on my software development skills, it will likely not be as pretty as it could be.
