# What is this repository?
This repo is my university project for my bachelors in Cyber Security. As such, I will NOT be accepting pull requests (Unless they're from Brett, my project supervisor, because it makes it easier to add notes).

## Why is it available publicly?
Because I was told I could, but also if I pretend that somebody is actually watching my progress, I might do some work prior to 6 hours before it's due in.

## NLP-IM-RAT?
* Natural Language Parsing
* Instant Messaging
* Remote Administration Tool

Doesn't that sound cool as hell?

## What is the title of the project?
An Investigation into Network Monitoring with Natural Language Processing

## What is an actual brief description of the project?
An investigation into new ways of informing remote administrators of system and network information as well as parsing and acting upon requests from the administrator in an instant-messaging fashion. The goal is to identify and implement a method that allows an administrator to communicate with a bot in a natural language to improve productivity and workflow when off-site and away from usual resources.

## What will you be writing the tool/bot in?
Likely Node.JS, though since I'm not technically being graded on my software development skills, it will likely not be as pretty as it could be.
